Summary of Learnings 📝

I have learned through this crash course the basics of OpenCV, and how to manipulate images and videos. Using that foundation I then learned how to detect simple edges, lines, and then human features such as the face, eyes, and even smiles. Finally, adding to the human features is the classification between these different faces using algorithms built into the OpenCV library.
